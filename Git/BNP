What are design patterns are used in Microservice.





Who do we need to check?


1) Missing Ranges

Question:
Given a sorted integer array where the range of elements are [0, 99] inclusive, return its
missing ranges.

For example, given [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], return [“2”, “4->49”, “51->74”, “76->99”]


2. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

Question:

Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most two
distinct characters.

For example,
Given S = “eceba”,
T is "ece" which its length is 3.
